Project to mimic a Smart-Home sensor by the Arduino Board. Features:
- Red Led: mimic the Heating system
- PIR sensor: in order to augment the Led light as people presences detected by the sensor increase
- PWM motor: mimic the A/C system
- Timers: to coordinate the systems
- MQTT and REST Protocol to use the Arduino Smart-Home Sensor as a WebApp
